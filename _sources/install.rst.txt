Installing VPLANET
==================

To install the development version of VPLANET, open a terminal and run

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplanet.git
   cd vplanet
   make

Currently, the installer doesn't add the VPLANET executable to your :code:`PATH` variable, so
you'll have to `do it manually <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix>`_.
