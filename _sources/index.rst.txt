VPLANET Documentation
=====================

Planetary systems evolve due to a myriad of processes, often non-linearly,
which complicates simulating exoplanetary systems. The relevant
physical processes have often been modeled and explored within
disparate fields of science, so a universal model of planetary system
evolution must unite theories developed in multiple scientific disciplines.
VPLANET is a new interdisciplinary model of planetary system evolution that
self-consistently tracks stellar, orbital, tidal, rotational, atmospheric, internal,
magnetic, climate, and galactic evolution for generic planetary systems, but focusing on
systems with habitable worlds.
